        My name is Jakub Bartosik. I was born on 20th of July 1997 in Szczecin, Poland.
        My hobby from an early age is football. I was playing in SL Salos Szczecin
        and MKS Pogon Szczecin for 14 years. In 2016 I started study
        Computer Science in West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin.
        After two years of studying I decided to take part in "Erasmus+" student exchange programme and go to
        Cyprus, where in PA Collage I was studying for one year.
        This oportunity allowed my develop a lot of
        skills (among others level of English and programming).
        I found another adventage in Cyprus and I participated in internship
        at DOREA Educational Institute within Erasmus as well, that lasted 2 months, where I took care of
        website and got experience in using wordpress. Meanwhile, I
        attended course about <a class="textLink popupBtn"
            data-src="images/prizes/declaration_of_obtained_competences.jpeg" data-title="Cyber Security course">"Cyber
            Security"</a>. After I came back to Poland I was taking part in
        <a class="textLink popupBtn" data-src="images/prizes/IAI_dyplom.jpeg" data-title="Webcamp">front-end webcamp</a>
        in IAI in Szczecin, where I gained professional approach with
        creating websites.
        Currently I am about to finish my dissertation and the aim is
        to create secure website for managing dance school. Since I had started to learn how to create websites
        I had a few projects that results you can check in projects section.
